The purpose of this project is to lay the groundwork for a future version
of http://www.noteshare.io[Noteshare.io] -- a (technical) web publishing
site powered by the awesome http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor.org] text
processing engine.  In addition to supporting Noteshare.io, the project
aims to develop a good chunked editing system.
